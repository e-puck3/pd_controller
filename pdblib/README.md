# PD Buddy Firmware Library

This library implements a subset of the USB Power Delivery Specification,
Revision 2.0, Version 1.3, and Revision 3.0, Version 1.1, for microcontrollers
running [ChibiOS][] and connected to an [FUSB302B][] USB Power Delivery PHY.

The library's API is not yet considered stable, and is not documented outside
of source code comments.  For an example of its use, see the [PD Buddy Sink
Firmware][].

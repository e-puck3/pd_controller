=================

This repository is a fork of the PD Buddy Sink Firmware https://git.clarahobbs.com/pd-buddy/pd-buddy-firmware.git.
It has been modified to be able to run as a submodule to add to a main project. Only the library files and some functions of the Sink firmware have been kept. The library has been a little modified too in order to be more flexible with hot connections and disconnections of USB PD sources.

Follow intructions from the readme inside the folder platform_dependant_files to know how to add it to your project.
